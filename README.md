User Management System 🚀

This project is a user management system that allows you to view, edit, and delete users from a list.

Features 🎯
View Users: 👀 The application fetches and displays a list of users in a table format, showing details such as ID, name, email, and date of birth.

Edit User Details: ✏️ Each user entry in the table has an "Edit" button that opens a modal to update the user's details (name, email, and date of birth). Users can save the changes to update their data in the system.

Delete User: 🗑️ Each user entry has a "Delete" button that allows you to delete the user from the list. The deletion request is made to the server, and the list is updated accordingly.

Components 🧩
1. UserList
Displays the list of users in a table. 📊
Allows users to be edited or deleted via buttons in each row. ✏️❌
Fetches user data from an external API when the component is mounted. 🔄
Handles error and success messages based on API interactions.
2. Modal
A modal dialog used to edit user details. 🖊️
Contains fields for name, email, and date of birth, which can be updated by the user. 📅
The modal can be opened by clicking the "Edit" button and closed via a "Cancel" button. ❌
How It Works ⚙️
Fetching Users:

When the component is loaded, it fetches the user data from the specified API endpoint using axios. The fetched data is stored in the users state and displayed in a table format. 🔄
Editing a User:

Clicking on the "Edit" button next to a user opens a modal with that user's details pre-filled. ✏️
The user can modify the fields and submit the form to update the user. 💾
On successful submission, the user's details are updated in the list.
Deleting a User:

Clicking on the "Delete" button next to a user prompts an API request to delete the user. 🗑️
If the deletion is successful, the user is removed from the list.
Technologies Used 🛠️
React: The application is built using React for rendering the user interface. ⚛️
Axios: Used for making API requests to fetch, update, and delete user data. 🌐
CSS: Custom styles are applied to elements for layout and design. 🎨
Setup 🏁
Clone the repository to your local machine. 🖥️

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

npm install
npm run dev
Start the development server:
The application will be running at localhost🌐

API Integration 🔌
This application expects an API that supports the following actions:

GET /users: Fetches the list of all users. 📡
PUT /users?id=<user_id>: Updates a user's details by ID. 🖊️
DELETE /users?id=<user_id>: Deletes a user by ID. 🗑️
Ensure the backend API is running and accessible for the front-end to work properly.

Conclusion 🎉
This user management system is a simple and efficient way to view, edit, and delete user data. ✅




GitHub Usage Guide for the Project

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to use GitHub for this project, including cloning, making changes, and pushing updates.

Prerequisites

Install Git on your system.

A GitHub account.

1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the project, run:

# Clone via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

# OR Clone via SSH
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git

Navigate into the project directory:


2. Configure Git (If Not Done Already)

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

3. Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended)

To work on a new feature or fix a bug, create a new branch:

git checkout -b feature-branch-name

After creating a branch, verify with:

git branch

4. Make Changes and Commit

After modifying files, add changes to staging:

git add .  # Adds all changed files

Commit the changes with a meaningful message:

git commit -m "Your commit message here"

5. Push Changes to GitHub

If you are working on a branch:

git push origin feature-branch-name

If you are working on the main branch:

git push origin main

6. Pull Latest Changes from GitHub

Before making any changes, ensure your local repository is up to date:

git pull origin main  # Or git pull origin your-branch-name

If there are conflicts, resolve them manually before committing again.

7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click on Pull Requests > New Pull Request.

Select your branch and compare it with main.

Add a title and description for your changes.

Click Create Pull Request.

Once reviewed and approved, merge the PR.

8. Sync Your Local Repository After PR Merge

If your PR is merged into main, update your local copy:

git checkout main  # Switch to main branch
git pull origin main  # Get the latest changes
git branch -d feature-branch-name  # Delete the old branch locally

9. Handling Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts while pulling:

git pull origin main

Manually resolve conflicts in the affected files, then:

git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
git push origin feature-branch-name

10. Contributing to the Project

Follow proper branching strategy (feature/branch-name for features, bugfix/branch-name for bug fixes, etc.).

Write meaningful commit messages.

Keep your changes concise and documented.

Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.
